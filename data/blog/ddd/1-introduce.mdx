summary: What and when to use Domain Driven Design

# What and why DDD?
DDD (Domain Driven Design) is a aproach to design and build the software.
DDD is not sliver fit to all kind of project.

A software can have various characteristics, like:
- Performance
- Amount of data
- Biz complexity
- Tech complexity

DDD is suitable for the project which has Biz complexity and not for the other, for example: The Twitter like app, which requires Performance and Amount of data, but not Biz complexity. So it's not suitable for DDD.

The DDD aims to keep the biz rules at the heart of software.
- Keep the project complexity under control while it grows.
- Keep the software maintainable for the long run.
- Keep adding new feature without breaking the existing feature.

DDD leverage these principles:
- YAGNI: you are not gonna need it.
- KISS: keep it simple stupid.

# Main concepts of DDD
Strategic design concepts:
- Ubiquitous language: Brige the gap between the biz and tech team.
- Bounded context: Clear boundary between the different part of the software.
- Core Domain: Focus on the most important part of the software.

# DDD for everyone
DDD is not about writing code.
Comunication between Developers and Domain Expert is the key, and is two way communication.
- Domain Expert share their mental model and language
- Developers design the domain model, implement the software using the same language and can contribute back to the domain expert.
=> Try to be domain expert yourself first.

Why developers need to care much aobut the biz domain, the domain knowledge can get working on work project and hardly repeated when changing their job?
=> Deep domain knowledge will help to do the best job that a developer could possibly do.
=> Guide you through the model you design, the code you write and help you look at it from the domain expert's point of view.
=> Write technically correct code on one hand, and express the domain knowledge on the other hand.
=> Skill of systematizing the problem domain is resuable.
And eventually, you get familiar with these patterns and get work on new domain esier.

# DDD and UT
- UT coverage vs value distribution, at some point you might found that the value of reaching higher code coverage
 does not bring much value compare to the effort you invest to it. This number is around 80%.

- Domain model (A, E, VO, DE): 100% UT coverage
- Repossitory, Application Services, Factories: Not required UT, but IT.

- First, implmenting your model and refine it. Then apply TDD later (Write test first, then implement your model)
