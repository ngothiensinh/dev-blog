# Introduce
Get familiar with Entity and Value Object. Then build a snack machine around these concepts.

# Problem
- Problem Domain/Domain: the actual problem of the software we are going to solve.
- Core Domain is the subset of domain: the most important part of the software.
- Bissiness logic/Bissiness rule/domain logic/domain knowledge, and domain model are synonymous.

# Concepts
- Entity vs Domain: Both are code repensentation of the real world object.
- Types of equality:
  - Structure equality: Two objects are equal if they have the same value for all property (VO)
  - Identity equality: Two objects are equal if they have the same identity. (E)

In practice, you might see that VO does have identity property

E:
- Have identity
- Mutable
VO:
- Don't have identity
- Can be treated interchangeably if Structure equality is satisfied
- Immutable (Should create a new instance when changing the value)
- Doesn't have own table???

How to recognize a Value Object?
- It more depends on the domain you work on, a concept can be an E in one domain and a VO in another domain.
- Use the characteristics of VO and E to decide.
- Prefer VO over E.

Practices:
- Prefer VO over E
- Value Objects are light-weight
- Put most of the logic in VO
- E act as a wrappers
- Don't hestitate to update your domain model, example changing from VO to E if it's more suitable.

# Problem domain description
Build a software for a snack machine, which can:
- Insert money
- Return money
- Buy snack
