summary: Deploy k8s application using helm

# Why deploy k8s using Helm

Normal:

- Your app -> hard-code yaml (deployment/service/ingress) -> Kubectl -> AKS
  => Use Helm to simplify the application deployment process and avoid hardcoded deployment variables and settings.
  => Repeatable, reliable, manageable, resuable across mutil teams and env

New:

- Your app -> Helm chart -> AKS

Helm components:

- Client: is where helm was installed and responsible for creating and submitting the manifest files required to deploy aks application. (Communicate between user and k8s cluster)
- Charts: file to describe how the application deployed (chart/value/template)
- Releases: The application or a group of application deployed using Chart
- Repositories: discoverability and reusability of helm pacakges

# Concept

If 2 component depends on each other, try to use 1 chart and set the dependency
If 2 component are independent, create 1 chart for each component (Easier for bugfix and upgrade)

# Commands

```bash title="Create your own chart"
helm create <name> (Will create chart file template)
```

# Work with repos

```bash title="Helm repo cli"
helm repo add azure-marketplace https://marketplace.azurecr.io/helm/v1/repo
helm repo update
helm repo list
helm search repo <?partialname>
```

# To install a chart (This similar to `kubectl apply` command)

Run `helm install` to install a chart from:

- Chart folder: `helm install <release-name> ./drone-webapp`
- A packaged `.tgz` tar archive chart: `helm install <release-name> ./drone-webapp.tgz`
- A Helm repository: `helm install <release-name> azure-marketplace/aspnet-core`

```bash title="Debuging cli"
helm install --debug --dry-run <release-name> ./drone-webapp
```

# Lets install aspnet

```bash title="Step to release using helm"
az aks get-credentials -g learn-helm-deploy-aks-rg -n learn-helm-deploy-aks
# To release
helm install <release-name> azure-marketplace/aspnet-core
# To query all the installed release on the cluster
helm list

helm get manifest <release-name> (To get manifest file of a release, optional --revision)

helm delete <release-name> (To delete a realease)

# Install with set values

helm install --set replicaCount=5 <release-name> azure-marketplace/aspnet-core

# Upgrade a release

helm upgrade <release-name> ./app-chart (This bassically create new revision)

helm history <release-name>

helm rollback <release-name> <revision-id> (Run helm history to check first)
```

# Write a custom chart or extends it

## Template and function

To display the value as a string, you use `{{ quote .Values.ingress.enabled }}` or `{{ .Values.ingress.enabled | quote }}`
Chaning mutiple function: `{{ .Values.ingress.enabled | upper | quote }}`
Helm chart template support ~60 built-in function

## Conditional

```yml
{{- if | pipeline | -}}
  # Do something
{{- else if | other pipeline | -}}
  # Do something else
{{- else -}}
  # Default case
{{- end }}
```

## List

```yml | value.yml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  extraHosts:
    - name: host1.local
      path: /
    - name: host2.local
      path: /
    - name: host3.local
      path: /
```

```yml | template.yml
apiVersion: extensions/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
spec:
  rules:
    ...
    {{- range .Values.ingress.extraHosts }}
    - host: {{ .name }}
      http:
        paths:
          - path: {{ .path }}
            ...
    {{- end }}
  ...
```
