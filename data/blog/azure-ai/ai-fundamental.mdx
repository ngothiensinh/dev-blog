# Machine learning
Machine learning or machine learning model is a "thing" labeler
- A label could be a yes or no
- A lable could be a price (number)
- A label could be a group
- A label could be a category

To put in short, machine learning is how you put the label on the thing.
Then how do we make decisions over them.

# Software engineering vs Machine learning
- Software engineering: Knowledge + Data -> Recipe: Biz rule -> Answer
- Machine learning: Data -> Recipe: ML Model -> Answer

# ML model
- Regression: Whenever we have a number as a label, we will talk about regression model.
 Eg: Predicting the number of people who will buy a product
- Classification: Whenever we have a category as a label, we will talk about classification model.
 Eg: IsSpamEmail, IsNotSpamEmail
- Clustering: Whenever we have a group as a label, we will talk about clustering model.
 Eg: Grouping people based on their behavior. (The group is not existing before)

## Generative AI and Machine Learning
Both will have different use cases:
- Machine learning is traditional machine learning model
- Generative AI is a new model
 Eg: Generative AI can not be used for error-sensitive applications like self-driving cars.
